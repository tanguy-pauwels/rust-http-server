# Rust HTTP Server (Learning Project)

This project is a simple HTTP server written in Rust.
Its purpose is not to be used in any professional or serious context
but rather as a personal exercise to learn Rust and solidify my understanding of fundamental web concepts like the HTTP protocol.

It is based on the 2 first stage of the codecrafter project "Build your own HTTP server":
    https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/stages/ih0

# Why This Project?

I started this project to:

Learn Rust, focusing on its ownership model, error handling, and standard library.
Gain a deeper understanding of the HTTP protocol by implementing its basics manually.
Strengthen my skills in low-level web programming.

# Disclaimer
This project is purely for educational purposes and lacks robust error handling, scalability, and security features. Do not use it in production environments.

# Next Steps
 - Add support for dynamic routing.
 - Explore asynchronous Rust to handle multiple connections.
 - Implement a basic file server for serving static files.
